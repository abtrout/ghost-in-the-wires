## Ghost in the Wires 

My solutions to [37/38](https://github.com/abtrout/ghost-in-the-wires/blob/main/cryptograms/test_solutions.py#L318-L321) of the [cryptogram puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptogram) from [Kevin Mitnick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Mitnick)'s autobiography _Ghost in the Wires_.

These puzzles came from the paperback edition published by Back Bay Books in 2012. The original hardcover edition published by Little, Brown & Company in 2011 has a slightly different set of puzzles.
